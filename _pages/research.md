## Working papers

\[3\] Description and explanation
\[2\] Average density: weak limits and inference in non-regular semi-parametric problems (*submitted*)

## Work in progress

- A truncated kNN estimator of the average density
- What is statistical in causal inference?

## Notes and comments

- Numerical computation of maximin priors and minimax rules using Kempthorne (1987) and Chamberlain (2000)
- Comment on "Weak Signal Asymptotics for Sequentially Randomized Experiments" by Kuang and Wager (2023)
