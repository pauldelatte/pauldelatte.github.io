I am a PhD student in the [Economics department](https://dornsife.usc.edu/econ/home/) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). 

I specialize in econometrics and statistics. I have accumulated experience working with business data and macro-finance data. I am open to collaborations, both on theoretical and applied problems.

You can sometimes find me at the [USC Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/), either in the department of [Data Sciences and Operations](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations) or in the [Finance and Business Economics](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/finance-business-economics/) department.



## Research interests

- Statistical decision theory: minimax theorems; numerical approximation of least favorable priors and minimax rules; estimation in restricted parameter spaces.
- Causal inference, missing data, and experimental methods: weak identification and uniform inference; inference with adaptively collected data; A/B testing with market power.
- Bayesian inference: Bayesian nonparametric inference; Bayesian estimation of economic models; prior sensitivity; frequentist properties of Bayesian methods.
- Resampling and simulation methods: bootsrap consistency; fast estimation of economic models.
