I am a PhD candidate in [Economics](https://dornsife.usc.edu/econ/home/) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). 

I specialize in econometric theory. My [research projects](https://pauldelatte.github.io/research/) tackle statistical and optimization problems commonly encountered in causal inference and forecasting.

I have experience using advanced machine learning methods on large datasets and solving intricate optimization problems. I have helped research teams in industry and academia solve pricing problems, experimental design problems, and portfolio optimization problems. 

My CV is available [here](https://pauldelatte.github.io/cv/).

## Research interests

- Statistical decision theory and robust optimization: minimax theorems; numerical approximation of minimax rules and maximin priors; constrained minimax problems and optimization-aware solutions.
- Semi-parametric inference: bias correction and double machine learning; nearest neighbor methods in semi-parametric problems; bootstrap and resampling in semi-parametric problems.
- Causal inference and experimental design: model-free prediction-based causal inference; comparing model-based and design-based causal inference; inference with adaptive experiments; A/B tests in duopoly.
- Predictions, forecasts, and decision-making: ensemble methods; model-free predictive intervals; De Finetti's theorem and extensions; decision-making with predictions.
- Philosophy of statistics and probability: limits of model-free inference and prediction; exchangeability, resampling, randomization, and quasi-randomization; inverse problems and unobservables in statistics; limits of causal inference.
