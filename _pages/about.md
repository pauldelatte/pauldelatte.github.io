I am a PhD student in the [Economics department](https://dornsife.usc.edu/econ/home/) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). 

I specialize in econometrics. I try to develop statistical procedures for economic problems that are robust, computable, and interpretable. I also enjoy working with data. In particular, I have accumulated experience working with business data and macro-finance data. I am open to collaborations, both on theory problems and on applied estimation, either structural or causal!

I also enjoy discussing a lot of topics, related to economics or not! See Other for more.

You can sometimes find me at the [USC Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/), either in the department of [Data Sciences and Operations](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations) or in the [Finance and Business Economics](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/finance-business-economics/) department.



## Research interests

- Statistical decision theory: minimax theorems; numerical approximation of least favorable priors and minimax rules; estimation in restricted parameter spaces.
- Causal inference and missing data problems: robust imputation; causal inference in misspecified models; inference with adaptively collected data (A/B testing and bandit).
- Bayesian inference: Bayesian nonparametric causal inference; Bayesian estimation of DSGE models; Bayesian estimation of choice models.
