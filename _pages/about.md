I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://dornsife.usc.edu/econ/home/) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). 

I specialize in econometrics and statistics. I have accumulated experience working with economic data and economic models as well as programming statistical and econometric procedures. My own research projects are available [here](https://pauldelatte.github.io/research/).

You can sometimes find me at the [USC Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/), either in the [Department of Data Sciences and Operations](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations) or in the [Department of Finance and Business Economics](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/finance-business-economics/).

## Research interests

- Statistical theory: non-parametric and semi-parametric inference; plug-in estimators and influence function-based corrections; kernel estimators and bandwidth selection; kNN and matching estimators; bootstrap for semi-parametric problems; statistical minimax theorems
- Causal inference: causal modeling and statistical methodology; observational and experimental identification strategies for economic applications; inference with adaptive experiments
- Robust econometrics: numerical computations of gamma-minimax procedures; calibration of uncertainty sets for economic applications; replicability of observational and experimental procedures
