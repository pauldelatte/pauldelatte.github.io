I am a PhD candidate in [Economics](https://dornsife.usc.edu/econ/home/) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). 

I specialize in econometric theory. My [research projects](https://pauldelatte.github.io/research/)) cover statistical and optimization problems that are foundational for causal inference and model-based inference.

I have experience solving optimization problems and using state-of-the-art machine learning methods on large datasets. I have helped research teams in industry and academia solve pricing problems, experimental design problems, and portfolio optimization problems. My CV is available [here](https://pauldelatte.github.io/cv/).

## Research interests

- Semi-parametric inference: non-regular inference; plug-in estimators and double machine learning; bandwidth selection; kNN and matching estimators; bootstrap for semi-parametric problems.
- Statistical and econometric modeling: inverse problems and identification; inverse problems and misspecification; causal inference as inverse problems.
- Causal inference and experimental design: bridging model-based causal inference and design-based causal inference; inference with adaptive experiments; experiments in duopoly.
- Finance and macroeconomics: functional VAR and heterogeneity; robust portfolio optimization; beta strategies.
